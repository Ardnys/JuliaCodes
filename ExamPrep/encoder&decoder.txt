make an encoder which encodes the given string as follows:
AAAAABBHHFFFSSSSS 
[A5B2H2F3S5]
then decode the encoded array 

ENCODER

when you get to a new char, raise a flag which enters a loop and counts how many peeps there are
after that finishes, detect that and lower the flag
then it starts counting again to find a new char
repeat

declarearrayhere
hold = ""
ctr = 0
arrctr = 1
loop
if c != hold
    flag = 1
    j = i
while flag = 1
    if str[j] == v // match
        ctr++
        
    else if str[j] != v // no more match
        flag = 0
        arr[arrctr] = hold
        arr[arrctr+1] = "$ctr"
        arrctr += 2
        break
    j++
[AAABB]
which kinda works i guess now get rid of them useless undefs
